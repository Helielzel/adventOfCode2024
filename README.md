Just had some fun and practice with ibm i rpg free (sqlrpgle actually) and advent of code.

I use lib C to open and read IFS files (so located on an as400) in the first exercice, then I decided to use sql to read the input files. 
That's why the first day is in rpgle and the others are in sqlrpgle.
